        Our students experience balanced learning cut across theory, practical lab work, and competitive course work by which their minds are creatively engaged to encourage research and inno- vative practices in line with world standard understanding and approach. Staff and students are also involved in various extra-curricular activities, including regular seminars and presentations, real solution projects and research projects funded by government and industry. We make work experience part of the curriculum and support students in gaining relevant placement opportunities. We also provide advice and mentorship in order to help students tailor their careers and begin their integration in the workforce. The Faculty encourages students and staff to develop synergy across disciplines to facilitate the development of well rounded, educated, productive, and ethical individuals well versed in technology, social, and environmental issues.
