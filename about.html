Liam British College is a Private University located in Quebec, Canada.

The University was established in 1981 to provide high quality tertiary education for the countryâ€™s ever-increasing number of  school High School leavers.

At the time of institution, the university had three faculties (Arts & Social Sciences, Engineering, and Natural & Applied Sciences) and 93 students. As the University grew and thrived over the following years, the need to provide its high quality instruction at a higher level became increasingly apparent.

Thus, in 2007, Liam British College established its School of Postgraduate Studies.

Today Liam Britsh College has over 1.2 million students (undergraduate and postgraduate), 26 undergraduate programs across six faculties, and 36 postgraduate programs across five faculties.

This year Liam British College celebrates its 39th anniversary. We look forward to many more successful years ahead.
